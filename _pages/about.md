Hello! I'm Kasra Torshizi and I'm currently a second-year Computer Science PhD student under Dr. Pratap Tokekar at the University of Maryland, College Park. My research revolves around Robotics and Machine Learning, where I am partically interested in reinforcement learning, imitation learning, and control theory. I am currently investigating how learned priors can further enhance classical control methods. 

I previously completed my bachelors degree in Computer Science with a minor in Mathematics at UMD, during which I was involved in cybersecurity research with Dr. Dave Levin and completed two software engineering internships at Echostar. In my free time, I enjoy skiing, hiking, and cooking. 

I'm currently doing a major revamp of this website
